Black-on-black ware is a 20th- and 21st-century pottery tradition developed by the Puebloan Native American ceramic artists in Northern New Mexico. Traditional reduction-fired blackware has been made for centuries by pueblo artists. Black-on-black ware of the past century is produced with a smooth surface, with the designs applied through selective burnishing or the application of refractory slip. Another style involves carving or incising designs and selectively polishing the raised areas. For generations several families from Kha'po Owingeh and P'ohwhÃ³ge Owingeh pueblos have been making black-on-black ware with the techniques passed down from matriarch potters. Artists from other pueblos have also produced black-on-black ware. Several contemporary artists have created works honoring the pottery of their ancestors.

Black-on-black ware is a notable pottery tradition that emerged prominently in the 20th and 21st centuries, crafted by Puebloan Native American ceramic artists in Northern New Mexico. While the traditional reduction-fired blackware has been created for centuries by pueblo artists, the black-on-black style that has gained attention in recent times features a smooth surface adorned with intricate designs.

These designs are achieved through various methods:

Selective Burnishing: This technique involves polishing specific areas of the pottery to create a contrast with the unpolished areas, resulting in a glossy design against a matte background.
Application of Refractory Slip: A slip (a liquid mixture of clay and water) is applied to the surface of the pottery. During firing, the slip can alter the surface texture and color, contributing to the decorative design.
Carving or Incising: In this method, designs are carved or incised into the pottery surface, and the raised areas are polished. This creates a tactile and visual contrast between the polished and unpolished sections.
The craft of black-on-black ware has been particularly preserved and advanced by several families from the Kha'po Owingeh (formerly Santa Clara Pueblo) and P'ohwhÃ³ge Owingeh (formerly San Ildefonso Pueblo). These techniques have been passed down through generations, primarily by matriarchal figures within these communities. Artists from other pueblos have also embraced and contributed to the black-on-black ware tradition.

In recent times, contemporary artists have continued to innovate within this tradition, creating works that honor their ancestral pottery techniques while also exploring new artistic expressions. This continued evolution ensures that black-on-black ware remains a vibrant and respected art form within Native American pottery traditions.
